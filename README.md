# Identifying-Correlated-Assets-in-the-stock-market-with-Kruskal-Algo
Portofolio management is one of the popular topic in the financial market industry. It helps investors to take advantage of the different opportunities observed in a set of assets while reducing the related risk. One of the question is how to select less correlated assets in such a way that the portfolio is less exposed to leverage effects. More specifically how can we identify correlated/noncorrelated assets while ensuring the minimal exposition of the capital.  The goal of this notebook is to shows how we can group assets in sub-categories while ensuring that we are less exposed. For this purpose, we will use the Kruskal's algorithm. We will use a set of 50 shares from yahoo finance.
